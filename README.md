# Find Your W.C. - Temporary Project Title

## Description
The idea of the project got started from some experience about toilets when I traveled. I believe that I am not the only one who urgently wanted to find a nice toilet, ideally free. If it is an emergency toilet situation, the trip will probably end up being a nightmare. 

So, I have been thinking that it would be amazing to have a place where people can share their experiences about toilets such as addresses, price, cleanliness and etc.

This repository is particulary for the frontend of the application I am building.
